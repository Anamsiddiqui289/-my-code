#education is the process of acquiring knowledge and skills, 
#building morals, values, and developing habits. 
#Education does not just consist of these. 
#The process of education can be said to be complete only 
#if you are able to put the knowledge you acquire to good use. So, 
#education is not just gaining knowledge and gathering information 
#but developing the ability to apply what you have learned to daily life scenarios.
